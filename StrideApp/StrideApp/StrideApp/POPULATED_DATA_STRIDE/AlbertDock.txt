The royal Albert dock is a complex of dock buildings and warehouses in Liverpool, England , designed by Jessie Hartley and Philip hardwick. It was opened in 1846 and was the first structure in Britain to be built from cast iron, brick and stone, with no structural wood. As a result, it was the first non-combustible warehouse system in the world. It was known simply as the albert dock until 2018 when it was granted a royal charter. At the time of its construction, the dock was considered to be revolutionary in its design as ships were loaded and unloaded directly from or to the warehouses. Two years after it opened it was modified to feature the world's first hydraulic cranes due to it;s open but secure design the dock became a popular store for valuable cargo such as: brandy, cotton, tea, silk, tobacco, ivory and sugar however, despite its advanced design the rapid development of the shipping technology meant that within 50 years , larger and more open docks were required, although the albert dock remained a valuable store for cargo.
